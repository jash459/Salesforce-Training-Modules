### See Your Data Model in Action

D'Angelo has created custom objects, fields, and relationships, making the app's data model more complicated. Schema Builder is a tool that helps to visualize and edit complex data models, making it useful for designing and understanding such models

 - From Setup, search for and click Schema Builder in the Quick Find box.

The Schema Builder in Salesforce allows you to drag and move objects on a canvas to visualize your data model. This is useful for presenting customizations to colleagues and understanding how data flows in your system. Moving objects does not change the relationships or data.

### Create an Object with Schema Builder

To create objects in Salesforce, you can use Schema Builder's visual interface. Go to the Elements tab on the left sidebar, drag and drop the Object onto the canvas, enter object details, and click save. The new object will be added to the Schema Builder. Then, you can add fields to the object.

### Create Fields with Schema Builder

To create fields using Schema Builder in Salesforce, go to the Elements tab and select a field type, then drag it onto the object you want to add the field to. You can create relationship fields, formula fields, and normal fields. Fill out the details of the field and click Save. The new object will be visible in Object Manager along with other objects.

### Sum It Up

The module covered data modeling and databases, including objects, fields, and records. Schema Builder was introduced as a tool for visualizing relationships between objects. With continued learning, familiarity with custom objects and fields will increase, leading to proficiency in data modeling.
