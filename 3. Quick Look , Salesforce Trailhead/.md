You can start typing in the Quick Find box and the list will show only the pages that match your search term. Click on the name of the page to go directly to it.

### Use the Object Manager to Customize Objects

The Object Manager is a centralized tool within an organization that allows admins to manage all objects, including standard and custom ones, from one place. It provides access to various object settings, such as fields, layouts, and record types. To access the Object Manager, go to Setup and click Object Manager.

To customize an object, select the object name in the list, and then select a specific customization from the left pane. For example, to add a custom field to the Account object, select Account, then Fields & Relationships, and then New.
