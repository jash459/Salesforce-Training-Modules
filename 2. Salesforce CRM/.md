### What Is Salesforce?

Salesforce is a customer success platform that enables businesses to manage relationships with customers, collaborate with employees and partners, and store data securely in the cloud. It provides standard products and features but also allows for customization and extension beyond out-of-the-box functionality. CRM, or customer relationship management, is a key component of Salesforce's offerings.

### What Is CRM? 

CRM technology enables businesses to manage customer relationships and track interactions. Salesforce stores this data securely in the cloud, allowing teams to collaborate, gather insights, track metrics, and communicate via multiple channels. It is an improvement over using a spreadsheet to manage customer data.

### How Salesforce Organizes Your Data

Salesforce organizes data into objects and records, similar to tabs and rows in a spreadsheet. Objects can be accessed from the navigation bar, and records are specific data entries within an object. Data is securely stored in the cloud with an easy-to-use interface accessible from desktop and mobile devices. Standard objects are already set up, and data can be imported using point-and-click tools.

 - Record : An item you're tracking in your database; if your data is like a spreadsheet, then a record is a row on the spreadsheet
 - Field : A place where you store a value, like a name or address; using our spreadsheet example, a field would be a column on the spreadsheet
 - Object :A table in the database; in that spreadsheet example, an object is a tab on the spreadsheet
 - Org : Short for “organization,” the place where all your data, configuration, and customization lives. You and your users log in to access it. You might also hear this called “your instance of Salesforce”
 - App : A set of fields, objects, permissions, and functionality to support a business process


### Salesforce Standard and Custom Objects

Salesforce CRM uses various standard objects such as Accounts, Contacts, Leads, and Opportunities to manage and access data in a sophisticated way. These objects allow you to track companies, individuals, potential prospects, and qualified leads that you have converted. By linking these records together, you can gain a comprehensive view of your data and see how they are related. Salesforce CRM provides a powerful alternative to using simple spreadsheets for managing your business data.

Salesforce CRM is built on a platform that allows customization. As an example, an admin can build a process for managing work requests from sales managers by creating a custom object called "Projects" and a form for requesting work, with each form submission creating a record stored in Salesforce.

Salesforce CRM offers features such as automatic email notifications, dashboards, and reports to manage and track leads, opportunities, contacts, and accounts. Salesforce's Lightning Experience provides a user-friendly interface to help sales reps close deals more efficiently.

### Introducing Lightning Experience

Salesforce offers a modern, efficient user experience called Lightning Experience that helps sales teams close deals faster. It caters to the growing influence of mobile in sales by providing features for mobile usage like researching clients and getting directions. Salesforce also offers a mobile app in addition to the desktop version.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/lex_implementation_basics/lex_implementation_basics_welcome/images/301476ff9e67745b8fb46950dc173dbf_lex-computer-oppty-wkspace.png)


Lightning Experience is a Salesforce feature that enhances sales productivity with optimized pages and interactive tools for data visualization. It also supports service teams. The name comes from its fast and dynamic performance. It was built to help sales reps focus on the right deals and activities, while also providing excellent customer service.

### Why We Built Lightning Experience


Salesforce named its Lightning Experience after the qualities of actual lightning: speed, beauty, and uniqueness. The experience is designed to help sales reps sell faster with personalized alerts and an interactive assistant. It was created based on customer feedback and is a killer sales app for sales reps.

### What Makes Lightning Experience So Special

Lightning Experience offers several benefits, including easy navigation through pages and apps using the navigation bar, a Notes tool for easy note-taking with autosave and rich text capabilities, and powerful search capabilities that allow users to find records quickly, including recent records and top search results.

### Home


Home is a smart home page for sales teams, providing tools to help them start their day quickly. It includes a Performance Chart to track progress towards sales goals, News and social highlights for insights, and an Assistant with a to-do list. Sales reps can focus on their Top Deals to prioritize their selling activities.

### Opportunity Workspace

The opportunity workspace is a powerful tool for sales reps to focus on selling. It includes coaching scripts, insights, and a timeline for the sales process. The highlights panel shows key details, and the composer allows for quick task creation. Customizable sales paths offer coaching details, and Quick View provides information without leaving the page. Related records can also be added in context.

### Accounts and Contacts

Salesforce creates an account and contact when a lead is converted. The account is the company and the contact is the person who works there. The layout for these pages is optimized for quick reference. Features like integrated Twitter and News, field-level duplicate matching, and the ability to review past and upcoming activities make it easier for sales reps to find information efficiently.

### List Views

In Salesforce, list views can be customized using filters to show important records. With Lightning Experience, list view charts allow for easy data visualization without the need for an admin. Users can create filters and search for list views quickly.

### Opportunity Kanban

The Opportunity Kanban is a visual tool for sales reps to track their deals at each stage of the pipeline. It allows for easy movement of deals between stages through drag-and-drop, and provides personalized alerts for important deals. Additionally, filters can be created to slice data as desired.

### Reports and Dashboards

Reports in Lightning Experience offer more advanced filtering, summarizing, grouping, and visualization capabilities compared to list views. Sales reps can create custom filters, while admins can create visually appealing dashboards with flexible layouts and spanning columns. Matrix reports have auto-hidden details and the ability to hide totals and subgroups for easier access to important information.

### The Navigation Bar


The Salesforce navigation bar is a container for various items and features that change based on the app you're using. It provides basic navigation functionality for easy access to different parts of the platform.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/lex_implementation_basics/lex_implementation_basics_setup/images/157986adc57ae889b38727787f66aab6_lex-nav.png)

The navigation bar in the app displays the app name and can be customized with unique branding. You can access other apps through the App Launcher icon or app name. Recent records and lists can be accessed directly from the navigation bar for certain items. Admins can create custom apps for users and the navigation bar can be personalized. To add a page to the navigation bar, open it in a new tab and select Add to Nav Bar.

To customize the navigation bar, click "Add More Items" to choose what to add, then reorder or rename items as needed before saving changes. Note that some items may not be deletable if specified by the app administrator.

### Items and Apps for Efficient Navigation

To access standard or custom objects in Salesforce, click on the item from the navigation bar. If the desired item is not visible, click the App Launcher icon to view other apps.

Salesforce's App Launcher displays all types of apps in one place, including custom, standard, Lightning Experience, and connected apps. The All Items section displays various resources, independent of the app. Users can search for apps and objects by name. The AppExchange can be accessed directly from Lightning Experience. Admins can customize the App Launcher's default order and manage app visibility. Users can personalize their view by rearranging tiles.

### Search for Records


Salesforce's Lightning Experience global search box is the quickest way to access the data you need from anywhere in the app. The search function is like a smart personal assistant that anticipates your needs and helps you find what you're looking for.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/lex_implementation_basics/lex_implementation_basics_setup/images/c279e4f443b0e37335ad14cc05f35e91_lex-global-search.png)

### Get Instant Results, Top Results, and More

As soon as you click into the box, search starts working for you. A list of recent items provides quick links to records you’ve recently visited.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/lex_implementation_basics/lex_implementation_basics_setup/images/6bebcf83c3f60a89e6b08a93e95f03e5_lex-global-search-mru.png)

Start typing, and the list dynamically updates with matches from all searchable objects. If you see what you’re looking for, select it to go right to the record.

Don’t see what you need in the dropdown list? Don’t worry—you’ve got options. To see results only for the object you’re on, select the second option in the instant results dropdown list.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/lex_implementation_basics/lex_implementation_basics_setup/images/95cff1f0aec7e80fed0067c774309764_lex-global-search-scoped.png)


The global search box in your organization's platform allows you to search across the entire organization or for a specific object by typing its name next to the search box. The most frequently used objects are at the top, and the rest are listed alphabetically. Spelling correction and synonyms help find relevant results. You can select a highlighted object by clicking it or pressing Enter to see instant results limited to that object. To see full search results, press Enter again. To remove the filter, change the object to All.

### Refine Your Results

The Top Results feature allows users to easily find specific objects by selecting them from a list on the left. If an object isn't listed, users can select "Show More" to see all available objects in alphabetical order. The number of results for each object is also displayed.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/lex_implementation_basics/lex_implementation_basics_setup/images/b92d61d0d113678a08d3e95e4ef37eb7_lex-search-results.png)


You can filter and sort search results for various objects in Salesforce such as accounts, contacts, opportunities, and custom objects. Results are initially sorted by relevance based on factors like search term uniqueness, frequency in records, and ownership. You can sort results further by clicking column headers or using the sort dropdown menu.

### Can’t Find What You’re Searching For?

When searching for records, use specific terms and ensure that the object or field is searchable. Only results you have permission to view will be returned. If a record is not found, wait 15 minutes for it to be indexed or contact your admin.
