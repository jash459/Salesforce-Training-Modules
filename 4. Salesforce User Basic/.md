### What Is Salesforce?

Salesforce is a customer success platform that helps businesses manage their sales, customer service, marketing, analytics, and connections with customers. With its standard products and features, businesses can manage relationships, collaborate with employees and partners, and store data securely in the cloud. Before Salesforce, these tasks were likely disorganized and scattered across various tools.

Salesforce organizes your customer data in a simple interface, making it easy to manage contacts, work with prospects, organize tasks, focus on deals, collaborate with your team, and showcase your wins. It's accessible on desktop or mobile, anytime, anywhere, and on a secure cloud. Essentially, Salesforce is a one-stop-shop for sales productivity.

Salesforce provides a centralized platform where all data can be accessed in real-time without the need for manual updates or worrying about notes or files stored elsewhere. Managers can easily see the latest information on deals and sensitive data is protected by security and sharing features.

### Who Sees What?

Salesforce provides options for accessing and interacting with data, such as creating, viewing, editing, and deleting it, based on the settings maintained by the admin. Access can be simple or multilayered depending on the company's needs. By enabling the right security measures, collaboration within the company can be maximized. The admin is responsible for setting up and maintaining these access options.

### Collaboration using Salesforce

Salesforce provides a collaboration platform where you can create groups, ask questions, share files and get help from colleagues. The best part is that all the collaboration is stored for future reference and accessible to the whole company. This is the power of collaboration combined with CRM, which is the next topic to be discussed.

### What Is CRM?

CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management, a technology that helps manage relationships with customers and track data on interactions. Salesforce is a CRM tool that stores information in the cloud, allowing teams to collaborate, gather insights from social media, track metrics, and communicate across various channels. This replaces the need for using spreadsheets to manage customer data.

### How Salesforce Organizes Your Data

Salesforce organizes your data into objects and records. You can think of objects like a tab on a spreadsheet, and a record like a single row of data.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/lex_salesforce_basics/lex_salesforce_basics_welcome/images/ee8f113e08d652fcd4b8ec6c98234cd0_admin-intro-how-data-is-organized.png)

Salesforce is a cloud-based system that organizes data using objects and records. Objects represent a category of things, and records are specific instances of those things. Salesforce has standard objects already set up and can be accessed from desktop or mobile devices. It is similar to a spreadsheet, but with additional features such as tracking, sharing, and connected apps.

- Record :  An item you are tracking in your database; if your data is like a spreadsheet, then a record is a row on the spreadsheet
- Field : A place where you store a value, like a name or address; using our spreadsheet example, a field would be a column on the spreadsheet
- Object : A table in the database; in that spreadsheet example, an object is a tab on the spreadsheet
- Org : Short for “organization,” the place where all your data, configuration, and customization lives. You log in to access it. You might also hear this called “your instance of Salesforce”
- App : A set of fields, objects, permissions, and functionality to support a business process

### Salesforce Standard Objects

Here are some of the core standard objects you’ll be using with Salesforce, and a description of how each one is used.

- Accounts : 	Accounts are the companies you’re doing business with. You can also do business with individual people (like solo contractors) using something called Person Accounts.
- Contacts : Contacts are the people who work at an Account.
- Leads : Leads are potential prospects. You haven’t yet qualified that they are ready to buy or what product they need. You don’t have to use Leads, but they can be helpful if you have team selling, or if you have different sales processes for prospects and qualified buyers.
- Opportunities : Opportunities are qualified leads that you’ve converted. When you convert the Lead, you create an Account and Contact along with the Opportunity.

When a lead is converted in Salesforce, an account and contact are created. Accounts are companies you do business with, and contacts are the people who work there. The layout of account and contact pages is optimized for quick reference and finding information at-a-glance. You can keep your data clean with field-level duplicate matching and integrate Twitter and News for the latest news about your customers. You can also review past and upcoming activities easily.

### The Kanban View

The Kanban view helps you organize your work by displaying records in columns. You can update the status of a record by dragging it to a different column. You can customize the board by choosing which fields and summaries to show. You can also edit or delete records and create filters to view your data the way you want. For opportunities, you can receive alerts when action is needed on important deals.

## Work with Your Salesforce Admin

1. Objectives

  - Describe the role of your Salesforce admin.
  - Troubleshoot common questions on your own.
  - Start on the path to becoming a super user.

### What Is a Salesforce Admin?

the role of Salesforce Admins, who are responsible for customizing and configuring Salesforce to meet a company's needs. They also act as trusted advisors, designing automated processes, delivering training programs, and gathering feedback to improve the system. The size and complexity of a company's Salesforce implementation will determine the number of people supporting it.

### Work with Your Admin

As a Salesforce user, it's important to know how to request work from your admin. They may have set up a custom form or prefer requests through Chatter. Requests can fall into categories such as bugs, questions, and feature requests, in order of priority. Each type of request requires different handling and some may not need the admin's involvement. It's best to ask your admin how they prefer to receive requests to work together efficiently.

### Reporting a Bug

If you encounter a bug, try refreshing your screen or logging out and back in first. If that doesn't work, report the bug to the admin and include details. The admin will work with you on timing and troubleshooting. Salesforce has a feature that allows the admin to log in as you for troubleshooting purposes.

- Steps to reproduce : Numbered steps of what you were doing when the bug occurred.	
- Outcome : What is the bug?
- Expected result : What would you normally expect to see?
- Workaround available	: Is there a way to work around the issue?
- Severity : How urgent is the issue?
- Impact : Is this affecting just you, or other people too?

### Grant Login Access


To report an issue to your admin, it's helpful to let them log in under your username to see what you're seeing. To do this, click your photo in the upper right corner and select Settings.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/lex_salesforce_basics/lex_salesforce_basics_your_admin/images/14adac4e8bfd984eef0ced95c87d0fdb_lex-eu-settings-dialog-settings.png)

From the left sidebar, click Grant Account Login Access and set the duration.

### Asking Questions

Collaborating in Salesforce is a great way to find information and get answers to your questions. It's important to search for answers before posting a question. With many people using Salesforce, it's likely that your question has already been answered. Asking questions in Salesforce allows for crowdsourcing and getting answers from colleagues, super users, and executives.

### Feature Requests

As a Salesforce user, if you have ideas for improving the platform, you should communicate them to your admin through the designated channel for feature requests. However, bug fixes are usually given higher priority than feature requests. Your company may have a Salesforce steering committee that reviews and prioritizes feature requests for the roadmap. If you want to have more influence on the roadmap, consider becoming a super user.

### The Importance of Super Users

The paragraph describes super users as employees who are knowledgeable and enthusiastic about Salesforce. They enjoy helping their colleagues and providing feedback. If this sounds like you, consider becoming a super user and talk to your admin about starting a program if one doesn't exist.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/lex_salesforce_basics/lex_salesforce_basics_your_admin/images/3e5878090d3d60054adc4d27a8a25f9b_lex-eu-super-user.png)

Super users often share feedback, attend steering committee meetings, and weigh in on the Salesforce roadmap. They also swarm on questions in Salesforce and help other users.

### Common Questions

#### How do I reset my password?

To reset your Salesforce password, go to the login page and click on "Forgot your password?" Enter your username and answer any security questions. You will receive an email with a link to reset your password and access your account.

As a legal translator, I am not able to provide assistance with resetting passwords or navigating through software. However, I can explain that in Lightning Experience, the horizontal navigation bar is always located at the top of the screen and provides access to various objects, such as accounts and leads. It is important to note that if your admin has enabled single sign-on, the password reset procedure may be different and you should check with your admin for details.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/lex_salesforce_basics/lex_salesforce_basics_your_admin/images/f32ec4029fcb5502cce98e9a8cf6288e_lex-nav-bar.png)

If you’re looking for an object or feature that you don’t see in the navigation bar, just click App Launcher Icon in the navigation bar to open the App Launcher. Click View All to see all of your apps and items.

The paragraph suggests ways to get help and support for using Salesforce. Customers can access knowledge articles, get help from support, and give feedback about their experience. They can also join the Trailblazer Community to collaborate with other customers and learn best practices. Additionally, they can attend Salesforce events, such as user groups and Dreamforce, for training and inspiration.
