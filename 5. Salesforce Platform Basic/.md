## Get Started with the Salesforce Platform

1. Objectives

  - Define the Salesforce platform.
  - Describe the DreamHouse scenario.
  - Create a Trailhead Playground.
  - Explain the difference between no code (declarative) and programmatic development.

### A Quick Introduction to Salesforce

Salesforce is more than just a CRM as it offers a range of standard functionality to run your business. While it stores customer data, it also provides processes to nurture prospects and collaboration tools. Here are some common business activities supported by Salesforce's out-of-the-box features.

- Sell to prospects and customers : Leads and Opportunities to manage sales
- Help customers after the sale	 : Cases and Communities for customer engagement
- Work on the go : The customizable Salesforce mobile app
- Collaborate with coworkers, partners, and customers : Slack, Chatter, and Communities to connect your company
- Market to your audience : Marketing Cloud to manage your customer journeys

The features offered by a company's purchase are like a model house, usable but not personalized. The Salesforce platform allows customization and building of unique business applications, leading to greater success.

### Stories of Salesforce

Throughout Trailhead, you are introduced to a lot of companies and characters that are using Salesforce in different ways. Let’s meet some of the players.

Four companies are using Salesforce to streamline their business processes and improve their operations. Cloud Kicks and Ursa Major Solar use Salesforce to manage sales and customer service, while Get Cloudy Consulting leverages it to manage clients and innovate with Salesforce services. DreamHouse Realty uses Salesforce to improve the efficiency of their home sales.

DreamHouse Realty is a real estate firm where Michelle is the lead broker. They have web and mobile apps where customers can browse properties and contact brokers to set up showings. D’Angelo is the Salesforce admin at DreamHouse and he is building custom functionality to support Michelle and her team. Salesforce comes with standard sales tracking features, but DreamHouse needs industry-specific functionality, which D'Angelo is building.

### Get to Know Our Terms

In Salesforce, a database is like a giant spreadsheet where information is stored and accessed later. The information is stored in a specific way to ensure easy access. Object is a key term to understand in Salesforce.

Let’s take a look at a page from the DreamHouse app to define some of its important elements and how they relate to the database.

Salesforce apps consist of objects, fields, and other functionality that support business processes. Objects are tables that store specific information, and records are the actual data associated with an object. Fields are columns in object database tables, and org refers to a specific instance of Salesforce. A Trailhead Playground is a tool used to learn and practice Salesforce skills.

### Your First Trailhead Playground

A Trailhead Playground (TP) is a safe environment for practicing app development skills. It's a special type of Developer Edition (DE) org provided by Trailhead. Signing up for Trailhead automatically creates a TP for you, which is free and you can have up to 10 at a time. To create one, go to any hands-on challenge and select Create a Trailhead Playground. You can manage your TPs from your Trailhead profile.

### Install the DreamHouse App

To practice the steps in this module and complete the hands-on challenge, you need to install the DreamHouse package in your Trailhead Playground. Follow the instructions to launch the Playground Starter app, paste the package ID, and install it for all users. Then, approve third-party access and click Done. Finally, open the Dreamhouse app from the App Launcher and click the Settings tab to import sample data.

### Customize the Salesforce Platform

Salesforce allows for no-code (or declarative) development, where customization tasks can be performed using forms and drag-and-drop tools without writing code. An example of this is adding a custom field, like a prequalified checkbox, to a standard object such as the contact object. This can be done by accessing the Object Manager tab in Setup, selecting the appropriate object, clicking on Fields & Relationships, and creating a new field with the desired data type and field label. The new field can then be added to all relevant page layouts and viewed in the Dreamhouse app under the selected contact's Details tab.

The addition of a new field in Salesforce not only adds it to the user interface but also enables running reports, creating dashboards, and using it in the Salesforce mobile app without any additional effort. This showcases the power of the Salesforce platform, which will be discussed further in the upcoming unit.


## Discover Use Cases for the Platform

1. Objectives

    - Describe sample use cases for the platform.
    - Discover reasons for using the platform across multiple departments.

### High Impact, Low Effort

The Salesforce platform helps businesses move faster by streamlining processes and replacing manual tasks with more efficient ones. To start building on the platform, it's recommended to tackle projects that have a big impact but are easy to implement. An example from DreamHouse shows how email discussions about properties can get confusing, and the platform can help prevent details from being lost and mistakes from happening.

Salesforce platform helps DreamHouse Realty by providing Chatter feed tracking for the custom Property object created by D'Angelo. This feature allows multiple people to collaborate and comment on a particular record, storing all discussions and decisions on the record for everyone to stay updated. This eliminates the need for email communication for discussing specific properties.

Identify processes in your organization that involve a lot of emailing, spreadsheets, shared local documents, and manual tasks. These processes can have a big impact if streamlined with a custom object in Salesforce. Focus on processes that affect only a few departments to minimize stakeholder involvement while learning. Such projects can have a high impact with minimal effort.

### Other Uses for the Platform

The DreamHouse story uses Salesforce to assist real estate agents in selling houses, but the platform can be customized for various business tasks beyond sales. In this article, we will explore some of these other use cases.

### HR Can Use the Platform

Julian, an HR employee at DreamHouse, is struggling to manage the large amount of data from hundreds of job applications and hiring processes. D'Angelo proposes to create a custom app using Salesforce that can automate and streamline the hiring and onboarding process. The app can list job openings, store applicant information, send automated reminders, manage equipment orders, track employee time off, and be accessed via the Salesforce mobile app.

### IT Can Use the Platform

Regina, an IT professional, is overwhelmed with a flood of urgent IT tickets. She can seek help from her Salesforce admin, who can utilize the benefits of building the IT ticketing system within the same platform as the CRM. This enables the tracking of cases, collaboration, and other streamlined processes such as creating reports and dashboards, sending confirmation emails, queuing requests, creating custom forms and knowledge bases, and tracking hardware assets. This ultimately results in happier users and more time for IT to focus on infrastructure development.

### You Can Use the Platform

By now, you’re probably getting some ideas for projects of your own. Here are a few use cases for different departments.

- Finance : Budget management , Contract management , Pricing
- Product : Warranty management , Preproduction testing , Product ideas and innovation
- Supply Chain	: Procurement , Vendor management , Logistics
- Ops : Asset and facilities management, Merger and acquisition enablement, Business agility


## Understand the Salesforce Architecture

1. Objectives

   - Define key terms related to the Salesforce architecture.
   - Find information related to trust.
   - Explain at least one use case for Salesforce APIs.

### What Is the Salesforce Architecture?

Salesforce offers a highly customizable experience to customers, employees, and partners without writing much code due to its unique architecture. Understanding the architecture makes working with the platform easier. The architecture can be visualized as a series of layers on top of each other, similar to a cake.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/starting_force_com/starting_understanding_arch/images/a1b2bb1adfd5c5951a958fb019d4fbd2_platform-basics-arch.png)

Salesforce is a cloud company that offers everything in the cloud through a platform powered by metadata. The platform includes data services, artificial intelligence, and robust APIs for development, which are integrated into all the company's offerings and apps. Salesforce's prebuilt apps and those built using the platform have consistent, powerful functionality. The company places great importance on trust, multitenancy, metadata, and the API.

### Why Trust the Cloud?

Salesforce considers trust as their top priority and takes the responsibility of keeping their customer's sensitive data and functionality safe very seriously. They provide transparency through their trust site, trust.salesforce.com, which allows customers to access performance data, information about data security, and scheduled maintenance that may affect their access to Salesforce.

### Sharing Is Caring in the Multitenant Cloud

Salesforce operates on a multitenancy model where all customers share resources in the cloud. Regardless of business size, everyone has access to the same computing power and core features. Trust is important in this model, but Salesforce ensures data security and automatic upgrades without the need for manual installations or hardware concerns. All of this is made possible by multitenancy.

### The Magic of Metadata

Metadata is data about data, which includes the structure and configuration of an organization's data in Salesforce. For example, empty fields on a Property record are metadata, as well as page layouts, security settings, and customizations. Metadata helps give structure to an org's data and enables efficient data management.

### All About That API

APIs allow different software to connect and exchange information without needing to know the specifics of how it works. Salesforce uses API names to access metadata and data for custom objects and fields. This enables Salesforce to be highly flexible and allows for unique and creative solutions. The API is used every time Salesforce is used, whether for standard functionality or custom apps.

## Navigate Setup

1. Objectives
   
  - Locate Setup and identify its key elements.
  - Identify important menus for customizing your org.
  - Use Quick Find to access menu items.

### Setup: Your New Work Home

As a Salesforce administrator, you will spend a lot of time in the Setup area, which is your one-stop-shop for customizing and configuring your org. It's important to get comfortable with navigating Setup, and you can access it from any page in your Salesforce org by clicking on the gear icon and selecting Setup.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/starting_force_com/starting_tour/images/c60d91fdcc3d26c61359b1ef3e659a21_platform-basics-setup-tour.png)

The Object Manager is where you can manage standard and custom objects in your organization. The Setup Menu provides links to various pages for managing users and modifying security settings. The main window displays the Setup homepage. To navigate the Setup Menu, you can expand the appropriate menu and select the page you need, or use the Quick Find box to search for a specific page. For example, to manage user permission sets, you can go to the Users menu and click Permission Sets or search for it in the Quick Find box.

### Get Cozy with the Setup Menu

The Setup menu has three categories: Administration (managing users and data), Platform Tools (customizing data model, creating apps, modifying UI, managing code), and Settings (managing company info and security). The top five Setup pages to know about are not mentioned but can be found in the menu.

- Company Information : At-a-glance view of your org, Find your org ID, See your licensing information, Monitor important limits like data and file usage
- Users : Reset passwords, Create new users and deactivate or freeze existing users, View information about your users
- Profiles : Manage who can see what with user profiles , Create custom profiles

## Power Up with AppExchange

1. Objectives

- Develop your own AppExchange strategy.
- Install an app from AppExcha

### What Is AppExchange?

Salesforce has an app store called AppExchange where partners can offer their apps and solutions built on the Salesforce platform. These can be downloaded and installed at various costs, allowing users to enhance their experience with Salesforce.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/starting_force_com/starting_developer_console/images/be60784c4298b05cd999b736bc38f116_platform-basics-appex-home-new.png)

### Strategies for Success

To develop a good AppExchange strategy, first identify the departments that use or plan to use Salesforce. Research what's available on AppExchange that best meets stakeholder requirements, and discuss business cases with department heads to determine exact needs. Ask questions to identify apps that are the best fit for each department or business case. Test the app in a sandbox environment before deploying it in your production environment. Evaluate multiple apps and determine whether there are feature gaps or unwanted functionality. Install and deploy the selected app, keeping users informed and providing training and documentation as necessary.

### Install Your First App

AppExchange is a platform where you can find apps for your Salesforce org, but you can't just install any app without considering its compatibility and potential impact on your environment. Before installing an app, you need to carefully evaluate it. For example, if you want to install an app that provides dashboards, you need to follow the right installation process.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/starting_force_com/starting_developer_console/images/16851cdd7f4153dd63a28c428a0f99c0_platform-basics-appex-app.png)

To install an app, click "Get It Now" and follow the installation wizard. It's best to install apps in a non-production environment first to avoid conflicts. Choose to install in a sandbox or Developer Edition org. You also need to decide who should have app permissions: admins only, all users, or specific profiles. Modify user profiles before installing the app if you want to limit access to certain users.

### Where’d My App Go?

To find an app after it has been installed, you need to search for its package. In Setup, use the Quick Find box to search for "Installed Packages." Then click on the name of the package you installed, which should be the same as the one on the AppExchange download page. From there, you can click "View Components" to see more information about the package, including any conflicts with your own customizations.

### Some Final Thoughts

The Salesforce Labs provides free open-source apps on AppExchange, which can be customized and examined to learn more about the platform. This module has given a good foundation for exploring the Salesforce platform, and there are additional resources available for further learning.
