## Get Started with Picklists

### Objectives

  - Decide when to add a picklist field.
  - Decide which type of picklist you need.
  - Create a custom picklist.
  
### When to Use a Picklist

When you’re at a bakery ordering cookies, you want to know what kinds of cookies they have instead of just guessing what to order.

### Anatomy of a Picklist

Picklists have two parts.

There are two parts to managing picklists: the field and the value set. The field determines the type of picklist, whether users can select multiple values, and if it depends on another field. There are three types of picklists: standard, custom, and custom multi-select. Picklist fields can also be restricted or dependent/controlling. Values can be set individually, use the built-in set, or created as a global value set. This unit focuses on managing the field, while the next unit covers managing values.

### Standard Picklists

Standard picklists are pre-built in Salesforce and come with standard objects in your org. They have predefined values and can be shared among objects. However, to have more control and customization, you need to create a custom picklist field.

### Custom Picklists

To create a custom picklist in Salesforce, follow these steps:

  - Go to Object Manager and select the object to contain the picklist field.
  - Click on Fields & Relationships and then click on New.
  - Select Picklist and enter a Label for the field.
  - Enter the values for the picklist, with each value separated by a new line.
  - Optionally, sort the values alphabetically and choose a default value.
  - Choose whether to restrict the picklist's values to an admin-approved list.
  - Set field-level security and choose the page layouts where the picklist field will appear.
  - Save the picklist.
  - Custom picklists end with __c in their Field Name.

### Custom Multi-Select Picklists

When you create a custom picklist, notice the Picklist (Multi-Select) option, too.
 
![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/picklist_admin/picklist_admin_start/images/3eef1a3266cee6c685754840cd219635_multi-picklist-option.png)

Choose this option if you want users to select multiple values from the picklist. The selected values will be displayed in the field separated by a semicolon.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/picklist_admin/picklist_admin_start/images/6057069aa21526c67e97743799135560_multi-picklist-selections.png)

Picklists allow only one value at a time, while multi-select picklists allow one or more values. Multi-select picklists have a lower limit on the total number of values. Converting a custom picklist to a multi-select picklist is possible, but converting a multi-select picklist to a single select one will clear existing values. Reports using multi-select picklists should use contains or includes instead of equals. In report results and dashboards, multi-select picklist selections are grouped independently. Only specific functions can reference multi-select picklists in formulas.

### Restricted Picklists

Restricted picklists prevent users from adding new values and help maintain consistency in data by avoiding typos or unwanted values. Admins can still edit values. To set a restricted picklist, choose the "Restrict picklist to the values defined in the value set" option when creating a custom picklist. Unrestricted picklists allow new values to be added through the API, automation, or other apps but not through the user interface.

To change this setting on an existing picklist:

  - Go to the picklist detail page and select Edit.
  - Select Restrict picklist to the values defined in the value set. 
  - Click Save.

### Dependent Picklists

A dependent picklist is a tool that can guide users, save UI space, and improve data integrity. It filters values for one picklist based on a selection from another picklist or checkbox on the same record. For example, a bakery can use a dependent picklist to guide customers with allergies to cookies that don't have gluten or nuts. They can create a controlling picklist with options like "all," "gluten-free," or "nut-free," and set the cookie flavor picklist as a dependent picklist of the preference picklist. This way, when someone selects "gluten-free," the cookie flavor picklist will only show the gluten-free options.

## Manage Your Picklist Values

1. Objective
   
  - Manage values for picklists.
  - Use formulas to define picklist values dynamically.
  - Explain what happens to existing data as you change picklist values.
  
### Good Value Management Matters


The importance of standardizing flavor names for a cookie company is discussed in the paragraph. To ensure consistency in orders and records, it is recommended to use the same name for a specific flavor. Efficient picklist value management can save time and maintain data consistency in the organization.

### Where You Set Picklist Values

In Salesforce, picklists are fields associated with objects and can be managed on the Fields & Relationships page. Indexed fields, including picklists, are stored in a way that allows for fast retrieval, optimizing report generation and list views. Salesforce automatically analyzes performance and assigns fields to be indexed, which can be important for optimizing performance later on.

### Manage Picklist Values

To modify the values of a picklist field in Salesforce, go to Setup and select the object associated with the picklist field. Then, click on the "Fields & Relationships" option and select the picklist field's label. This will take you to the field's detail page where you can view and edit the values in the "Values" related list.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/picklist_admin/picklist_admin_manage/images/04ccb68fbdcadee5cf7c0b1ee7191ed7_manage-values-section.png)

The following actions can be performed on values:

``Create`` : Create a new value.
``Reorder`` : Reorder existing values.
``Replace`` : Replace existing values with a new value, another value, or a blank value (which removes it from existing records).
``Printable View`` : View all values in a printable format, useful for setting up dependent picklists.
``Chart Color`` : Customize chart and report colors for values.

### Active, Inactive, Deleted, and Replaced Values

On the detail page, you can edit, delete or deactivate values in the Values related list. Active values appear as an option in a picklist while inactive values don't, but they still exist in your org. Inactive values can be reactivated, while deleted values are removed entirely. Inactive values still exist in existing records containing the value. There is a limit on total combined active and inactive values, and hitting these limits requires deleting values. When replacing a value, decide whether to replace it or leave it blank. Deleting a value goes to the background jobs queue, and replacing a parent value in a controlling picklist requires re-creating the dependency using the new parent value.

### Edit Picklist Values

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/picklist_admin/picklist_admin_manage/images/6687057295f56fed4a3252f1b9d0aa70_manage-values-detail.png)

On the field’s detail page, click Edit to see more options for a single value.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/picklist_admin/picklist_admin_manage/images/b54ffdab81691449eb292b1d9233a698_manage-value-edit.png)

The following changes can be made to a picklist:

  - Label can be changed (how it appears in the UI)
  - API Name can be changed (for use in formulas and programming references)
  - Set the value as the default for the picklist
  - Change the chart color (for appearance in reports and dashboards)

### Why a Picklist Value’s API Name Is Important

The API name is a unique identifier for a picklist value, separate from its label in the user interface. It allows formulas and apps to refer to the value even if the label changes, preventing references from becoming invalid. This has been available since the Spring '17 release, and you can prevent the API name from changing to ensure the validity of references to the picklist value.

### Controlling Fields, Dependent Picklists, and Narrowing Values

Dependent picklist fields limit available options based on a selection in a controlling field. The controlling field can be a picklist or a checkbox. For instance, if the user selects "nut free" in a controlling checkbox, only cookie flavors without nuts appear in the dependent picklist field.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/picklist_admin/picklist_admin_manage/images/9063b34cb981a93b9dec3c6723492662_dependent-checkbox.png)

To set up a dependent picklist field, follow these steps:

  - Go to the object's management settings, then click "Fields & Relationships" and "Field Dependencies."
  - Create a new field dependency and select a controlling field and a dependent field.
  - Use the field dependency matrix to specify which dependent picklist values are available based on the selected controlling field value.
  - Optionally, preview your selections before saving.
  - Note that custom picklist fields can be controlling or dependent, standard picklist fields can only be controlling, and multi-select picklist fields can only be dependent.
  - You can set default values for controlling fields but not for dependent picklists.
  - When testing, consider record types, as they, together with the controlling field, determine the available dependent picklist values.

### Use Formulas for Default Picklist Values

Assigning a dynamic default value to a picklist can speed up data entry by changing the default value based on certain conditions and values from other fields. This can be done based on the viewer's profile or customer's purchase history, among other factors.

To edit a picklist field in Salesforce:

  - Go to Object Manager and select the object associated with the picklist field.
  - Click on Fields & Relationships.
  - Find the picklist field and click Edit.

  - Add your formula under General Options.

  -  Click Save.

### Change the Field Type to Allow/Prevent Multi-Selection

You can change the field type of a picklist, such as converting a custom picklist to a multi-select picklist, as needed.

To change a picklist field type in Salesforce, follow these steps:

  - Go to Object Manager and select the object associated with your picklist field.
  - Click Fields & Relationships and then click Edit next to the picklist field.
  - Choose "Change Field Type" to convert between multi-select picklist and custom picklist without multi-selection.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/picklist_admin/picklist_admin_manage/images/09eba1ac1637fd3e2249e48529e5cdca_picklist-change-type.png)


The picklist values can be easily managed and customized to suit specific needs, including changing the type of picklist used and modifying the behavior of the values. There is flexibility to make adjustments as necessary without needing to have everything planned in advance. Additionally, the upcoming unit will cover sharing picklist values across multiple picklists.



### Share Values with Global Value Sets

1. Objective

  - Create global value sets.
  - Manage global value sets.
  - Promote an existing field’s values to a global value set.

### Sharing Makes for Easier Caring

Global value sets allow sharing the same list of values among multiple picklist fields. For example, a bakery can assign the same set of ingredients to different fields. One field can have a single ingredient picklist, while another can have a custom multi-select field with multiple ingredients from the same value set.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/picklist_admin/picklist_admin_global/images/c9accc81e2144314562577282ab5c7fb_global-values-example.png)


Using consistent values across multiple picklists can improve accuracy and reliability of data entry. Updating a global value set will automatically update all picklists that use it with the revised values

### Create a Global Value Set

Global value sets are limited and cannot be made unrestricted. This safeguards your values because altering them affects all fields that use them. While you can make edits, it's important to create values that are suitable for multiple fields.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/picklist_admin/picklist_admin_global/images/f3a2dff8e7e097ae334b6c18c9fa8731_global-values-create.png)

To create a new global picklist value set in Setup:

  - Search for "Picklist" in the Quick Find box and select "Picklist Value Sets".
  - Click on "New" next to "Global Value Sets".
  - To create a global value set in Salesforce, provide a name and description for the set and enter the values, one per line. 
  - You can choose to sort the values alphabetically and/or use the first value as the default. 
  - After saving, you can reorder or re-alphabetize the values. 
  - The name and description appear in Setup, while the description is shown on the Picklist Value Sets list page.

### Use the Global Value Set in a Picklist Field

To create a custom picklist field in Salesforce, follow these steps:

  - Go to Object Manager and select the object that will contain the picklist field.
  - Click on Fields & Relationships and then click New.
  - Choose Picklist and enter a Field Label.
  - Select "Use a global value set" and choose the global picklist you want to use.
  - Set other field settings as needed and click Next.
  - Set field-level security for the picklist field.
  - Choose the page layouts where you want to include the picklist field.
  - Click Save.

### Manage Values for Global Value Sets

You can make changes to a global value set, such as reordering, replacing, or changing the default value. You can also edit, delete, or deactivate individual values. However, it's important to note that any changes made will affect all picklist fields that use the global value set.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/picklist_admin/picklist_admin_global/images/0c54028461a3ceb6a015964885858119_global-values-edit.png)

To access the details of a global value set, search for Picklist Value Sets in the Setup Quick Find box and click on the label of the desired set. The detail page allows you to edit the label, API name, and description, as well as modify individual values and their properties. When replacing a value, create the new value first and select the option to replace all blank values. If you delete a value, it will be processed in the background and you will be notified by email when the job is complete.

### Promote Existing Field Values to a Global Value Set

If you're not sure which picklist values would make a good global value set when creating a picklist field, you can still reuse an existing set of values that works well for another field. By promoting this existing value set to a global value set, you can use it when creating a new custom picklist field.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/picklist_admin/picklist_admin_global/images/2e10a8d4432869f5ab696e05750d3fbb_global-values-promote-button.png)

To convert a picklist to a global value set:

  - Go to the Fields & Relationships section of the object that contains the picklist.
  - Click Edit next to the Field Label for the picklist.
  - Click Promote to Global Value Set and enter a label for the global value set.
  - Accept or edit the Field Name.
  - Optionally, add a description.
  - Click Promote to Global Value Set again.


Global value sets provide efficiency and consistency for picklists used across multiple fields, but they have limitations. Independent custom field values offer greater flexibility but require more maintenance.
