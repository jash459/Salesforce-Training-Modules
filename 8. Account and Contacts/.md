## Store Information About Your Customers

1. Obective

  - Describe what business accounts and contacts are, and explain how they’re related.
  - Describe what a person account is.
  - Add a new business account and associated contact.

### What are Accounts and Contacts?

Salesforce uses accounts and contacts to store information about customers. Accounts are for businesses and contacts are for the people who work for them. Person accounts are for individual customers. Understanding how to use accounts and contacts is important for using Salesforce effectively. This module focuses on business accounts.

### Use Business Accounts to Track Companies

As a sales rep for Cloud Kicks, I am heading to a meeting with a customer, Get Cloudy Consulting. To impress them, I need to know their buying history, needs, and key personnel. I can find this information in Salesforce, where the companies I've sold to are business accounts.

  - To create a Get Cloudy account, click "Launch" at the bottom of the page to open your Trailhead Playground in a new tab.   
  - Once you're logged in, click the "Accounts" tab. If you can't find it, select "Sales" from the app picker.

  - Click New.

   - click save

To prepare for a meeting, review the account record which contains information about the company such as employees, deals, service requests, meeting history, and documents. Check if there are any outstanding service cases, like the one filed by Get Cloudy two months ago. If you're away from your computer, you can use the Salesforce mobile app to access most of the same account information by searching for the account and tapping on it.

## Use Business Contacts to Track People at Companies

Salesforce uses contact records to keep track of the people who work at a company. At Get Cloudy Consulting, there are two contacts: Alan Johnson and Leung Chan. Each contact record includes the person's employer, email address, and phone number. To follow along, create contact records for Alan and Leung in your Trailhead Playground under the Get Cloudy account.

  - Scroll down to Contacts, and click New.
  - Add a contact record for Alan Johnson.
First name: Alan
Last name: Johnson
Title: Sales Manager
Phone: (720) 444-1229
Email: alan@gogetcloudy.com
 - Click Save & New.
 - Add a contact record for Leung Chan.
First name: Leung
Last name: Chan
Title: Marketing Manager
Email: leung@gogetcloudy.com
 - Click Save.


To find Alan and Leung's contact records in Salesforce, go to the Contacts tab and locate them in the Recent Contacts list. They are both listed under the Get Cloudy account record. Click on their names to view their full contact record, which includes related lists of information like cases, meetings, and call logs.

### Track Your Customer Interactions

The usefulness of Salesforce records depends on the stored information. Besides basic contact details, keeping track of interactions and scheduled activities is crucial. Related information for each contact helps maintain team-wide updates. To maintain accuracy, it's essential to log recent calls, like the one with Leung.

  - View Leung Chan’s contact record.
  - Locate the Activity Timeline.
  - Click Log a Call.
  - Log the details of your call. (You’re the only one who knows what you just talked about, so only you can know what to enter here!)
  - Click Save.

### Get to Know Your Accounts and Contacts Better

Before your meeting, you can quickly check for updates about your account or colleagues by browsing the web or social media. This can include searching for news about Get Cloudy or the tech industry, or checking Alan and Leung's social network profiles, including Twitter activity.

### Find News on Accounts and Contacts in Salesforce

Salesforce has a feature called News which provides US news in English directly within the platform. The news content is tailored to the context of where you access it. If you view News on an account page, the articles will be related to that account, its executives, and industry. For contacts, news will be based on the account the contact is associated with. However, your organization's admin needs to enable the News feature for it to be available.

### Find Twitter Posts in Salesforce with Social Accounts, Contacts, and Leads


If your organization uses the News and Social Accounts, Contacts, and Leads features in Salesforce, you can view what your accounts, contacts, and leads post on Twitter. To follow a Twitter account from within Salesforce, you need to link the account or contact record to a Twitter profile and have a Twitter account. You can only see information available on the social network and use Twitter profile images as profile images in Salesforce. Your admin needs to enable the feature and you need to configure your personal settings before using it.

### Best Practices for Managing Accounts and Contacts

Establish and follow naming conventions for accounts to help identify and differentiate between them, and always associate contacts with an account. Don't let inactive accounts and contacts go unnoticed, and ensure active ownership of accounts to enable proper management. Keep records updated with new information to maintain accurate and useful data in Salesforce.

## Understand Account and Contact Relationships

1. Obective

 - Understand different types of relationships your accounts and contacts can have.
 - Relate a single contact to multiple accounts.
 - Create a hierarchy among related accounts.
 - Set up an account team.

### Three Key Account and Contact Relationships

There are three types of relationships in sales:

 - Between companies (accounts) and the people who work at them (contacts).
 - Between customers (accounts) and other customers (other accounts).
 - Between customers (accounts) and coworkers who deal with them (other Salesforce users).
Tracking contacts to multiple accounts helps to identify indirect relationships that may be useful for closing a deal. Account teams show which sales reps are working on a specific deal, helping to coordinate efforts more effectively.

### Contacts to Multiple Accounts


When dealing with contacts who may be associated with multiple companies, it's best to avoid creating duplicate records and instead relate the contact to each relevant account. The main account will be the one the contact is most closely associated with, while the others represent indirect relationships. This can be easily tracked using the Related Contacts list view, which allows you to capture custom details about these relationships and keep track of who you're talking to. Watch the video for more details.

### Use Relationship Details to Help Close Deals

Before meeting with Get Cloudy, you review the account record and contact list, which includes Alan and Leung's titles and roles. You also notice James Gordan, who has consulted for Get Cloudy, but isn't listed as a contact for the account. To ensure accurate representation of relationships, you can modify the Roles field and create custom fields like a checkbox for the main contact.

### Define Company Relationships with Account Hierarchies

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/accounts_contacts_lightning_experience/understand-account-and-contact-relationships-lightning/images/9aee1a384af13750fbf1d4c17243b97c_account-hierarchy-lex.png)


The companies Get Cloudy East, Get Cloudy West, and Get Cloudy Canada are related to the main Get Cloudy office in Boulder. Salesforce can generate a family tree for the accounts to show their hierarchy, which can be viewed by clicking the hierarchy icon next to the account name on the Accounts tab.

### Best Practices for Establishing Account Hierarchies

When deciding how to establish accounts for businesses with multiple locations, you have two choices: create one global account or establish location-specific accounts. While a global account makes it easy to find records and report at an enterprise level, it can be harder to manage information and see what each location needs. On the other hand, location-specific accounts allow for more granular reporting, specific sharing settings, and easier tracking of interactions for each account. We recommend using location-specific accounts to focus on customer success at each location while still being able to see the big picture.

### Define Employee Roles with Account Teams

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/accounts_contacts_lightning_experience/understand-account-and-contact-relationships-lightning/images/bedd8627179a7b806a3ae890302a32d6_account-team.png)

Account teams allow multiple people to work on an account with different levels of access. An administrator must turn on and set up roles for each team member. To save time, a default account team can be set up in personal settings and added to an account. The account hierarchy displays Get Cloudy's affiliated companies.
