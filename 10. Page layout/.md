### Page Layouts in Lightning Experience


When customizing page layouts in Salesforce Classic, changes may affect object record pages in Lightning Experience, but elements may display differently and some may not be supported. To create, edit, or delete an object's page layout, use the Page Layouts related list in the Object Manager. The highlights panel on a Lightning Experience record page cannot be customized using the page layout editor, but can be customized with a compact layout.

Supported Page Layout Elements in Lightning Experience:
 - ``Actions``: Actions can be displayed in various areas of a page layout, derived from the actions in the Salesforce Mobile and Lightning Experience Actions section of the page layout.

 - ``Canvas Apps``: Canvas apps are also supported in Lightning Experience.
 - ``Custom Links``: Custom links are displayed under the Details tab.
 - ``Fields``: Fields are displayed under the Details tab, and can be reordered or removed only via the page layout editor. The top-down tab-key order is not supported in Lightning Experience.
 - ``Related Lists``: Related lists are included as Lightning components in Lightning Experience. However, not all related lists are supported, and the related list type determines how many fields are displayed.
 - ``Sections``: Sections appear along with fields under the Details tab. Section headers can be controlled to appear or hide on the detail page and edit page.
Report Charts: Report charts added to a page layout appear under the Details tab in Lightning Experience.
 - ``Standard and Custom Buttons``: Standard and custom buttons are treated as actions in Lightning Experience, and custom buttons that call JavaScript are not supported.

 - Mobile Cards
 - S-Controls
 - Section header visibility for Edit Page

### Compact Layouts in Lightning Experience

A compact layout displays key fields of a record in the highlights panel of a record page in Lightning Experience and the Salesforce mobile app. You can assign different compact layouts to different record types. The first seven fields (or fewer on smaller screens) appear in the highlights panel, and the first field is highlighted. Lookup relationship fields display the first five fields from the compact layout in a highlights panel. Changes made to a compact layout affect both Lightning Experience and the Salesforce mobile app. Compact layouts also determine the fields that appear in the details section of expanded activities in the activity timeline. You can create and edit compact layouts from the Compact Layouts related list on an object in the Object Manager.

### Create a Page Layout for Readers


Maria needs to create different page layouts for article readers and authors. She starts with creating a page layout for readers by going to Setup > Object Manager > Knowledge > Page Layouts > New. She chooses to create a new layout from scratch and names it "Procedure - Reader". The layout editor then opens up for her to make necessary changes.

The paragraph describes the Salesforce page layout editor, which allows users to customize the layout of their records. The editor includes a palette containing fields and actions that can be added to the layout, as well as a section for displaying the details of the record. Users can drag and drop items from the palette to customize the layout.

### Add Actions and Fields

Maria keeps the palette open and consults the list she made with Ada. She’s going to set up the page layout section by section: actions readers can perform, article information, article details, and article properties.

First, she sets up the actions that readers can perform on the article.

  - In the palette, click Mobile & Lightning Actions.
  - Hover over the Salesforce Mobile and Lightning Experience Actions section.
  - Click Override. to customize the predefined actions.
  - Drag Post to the Salesforce Mobile and Lightning Experience Actions section. Post allows users to post to the Article Feed.
  - Drag Poll next to Post.

Next, she sets up the Knowledge Detail section. The Title and URL name fields are already there and set as required. She adds one field.

 - In the palette, click Fields.
 - Drag Summary to the Knowledge Detail section.
  
Now she creates a section with more information about procedures.

- Drag Section from the palette to below the Knowledge Detail section.

 - Name the section. Maria enters Article Details.
 - Leave the defaults checked, then click OK.
 - Click Save.

Maria has to create custom fields to finish the Article Details section. She decides to create the other sections first and then come back to the custom fields. Here’s what she does.

 - To reopen the editor after saving, click Page Layouts.
 - To reopen the page layout, click Procedure - Reader.
 - Create a section under Article Details. Maria uses the following values:
   - Section Name: Properties
   - Layout: 2-Column
   - Tab-key Order: Top-down
 - Add the following fields to the first column:
   - Article Created Date
   - Created by
   - Last Modified by
   - Last Publish Date
 - Add the following checkboxes to the second column:
   - Visible in Internal App
   - Visible to Customer
   - Visible to Partner
   - Visible in Public Knowledge Base
 - Click Save.

### Create Custom Fields

Maria has set up everything she can using the fields in the palette. On to creating custom fields for the Article Details section.

The first field she creates is Procedure Audience, a text field for describing an article’s audience.

  - From Setup Setup icon., choose Setup.
  - Click Object Manager and select Knowledge.
  - Click Fields & Relationships.
  - Click New.
  - Choose the field type. Maria chooses Text Area (Rich).
  - Click Next.
  - Fill out the values. Maria uses these values.
  - Field Label: Procedure Audience
For Length, # Visible Lines, and Field Name she leaves the default values.
  - Description: Use this field to identify who follows or executes this procedure.
Help text: Who follows this procedure?
  - Click Next.
Establish field-level security. Maria selects Visible for all profiles.
  - Click Next.
  - Add the field to the palette for the page layout you’re creating. Maria chooses Procedure - Reader. Salesforce adds the new field as the last field in the first section by default. That’s where Maria wants it to go, but she can move it anytime if she changes her mind.
  - Click Save.


Maria repeats these steps to create custom fields for Procedure Warnings, Procedure Purpose, and Procedure Steps. She makes sure that the fields are in the correct order in the Article Details section.

Here’s her finished page layout for procedure readers.

### Create a Page Layout for Authors

Maria creates a new page layout called "Procedure - Author" from the existing "Procedure - Reader" layout. The two layouts are similar, but the author layout includes additional actions and an "Internal Notes" field only accessible to agents who can author articles.

Here’s how Maria creates and assigns the Procedure record type.

  - From Setup icon., choose Setup.
  - Click Object Manager and select Knowledge.
  - Click Record Types.
  - Click New.
  - Select an existing record type to use as a template. The new record type includes the picklist values of the selected record type. Maria chooses Master.
  - Enter a label for your record type. Maria enters Procedure.
  - Enter a description. Maria enters For step-by-step instructions.
  - Select Active to make this record type available immediately.
  - Select the profile that will use this record type. Maria selects Make Available next to the Customer profiles listed.
  - Click Next.
  - Select the page layout that users with these profiles see for this record type. Maria chooses Procedure - Reader.
  - Click Save.
  - All users assigned the Customer profiles see the Procedure - Reader page layout. They can view articles, but they can’t edit them.

Next, Maria assigns the Procedure - Author page layout to agents using the regular profile user interface. Agents can edit articles.

  - From Setup icon., choose Setup.
  - Enter Profiles in the Quick Find box, then select Profiles.
  - Select a profile. Maria chooses Custom: Support Profile, a profile she created earlier.
  - Scroll down to Custom Record Type Settings and click Edit.
  - Move the needed record types from the Available Record Type box to the Selected Record Types box. Maria adds FAQ and Procedure.
  - Choose a default record type. Maria chooses FAQ.
  - Click Save.

Maria added a new article type called procedures in Ursa Major's knowledge base. She created various page layouts and assigned them to the appropriate users using record types. Ada needs to start creating procedures now. Lightning App Builder module allows for more customization options, including adding and customizing components on record pages.
