But looking at data in tables isn’t ideal for humans. That’s where the data model comes in.

In Salesforce, we think about database tables as objects, we think about columns as fields, and rows as records. So instead of an account spreadsheet or table, we have an Account object with fields and a bunch of identically structured records

A data model refers to the objects and fields within an app. Objects represent different types of data, while fields define the characteristics of that data. Building a data model involves creating and organizing these objects and fields within the app.

### Get to Know Objects

Salesforce has two main types of objects: standard and custom. Standard objects are pre-built and commonly used in business, while custom objects are created to store specific information unique to a company or industry. A custom object like DreamHouse's Property object can be used to store information about homes being sold. Objects provide special functionality, such as automatically building page layouts for the user interface.

### Create a Custom Object

  - Scroll to the bottom of this page and create a trailhead playground. Don’t skip this step! You need to use a fresh and clean Trailhead Playground for this module.

Note: Even if you're completing this module as part of the Admin Beginner trail, be sure and create a new Trailhead Playground to complete these steps. You don't need to reinstall the Dreamhouse app in the new playground org.
  - Once your playground is created (it takes a minute!), press Launch.
  - Click the gear icon The setup gear. at the top of the page and launch setup.
  - Click the Object Manager tab.
  - Click Create | Custom Object in the top-right corner.
  - For Label, enter Property. Notice that the Object Name and Record Name fields auto-fill.
  - For Plural Label, enter Properties.
  - Prior to saving the custom object, scroll to the bottom of the page and select the checkbox Launch New Custom Tab Wizard after saving this custom object.
  - Leave the rest of the values as default and click Save.
  - On the New Custom Object Tab page, click the Tab Style field and select a style you like. The style sets the icon to display in the UI for the object.
  - Click Next, Next, and Save.

### Get to Know Fields

Salesforce standard objects have standard fields such as identity, system, and name, and prebuilt fields. Custom fields can be added to both standard and custom objects, with different data types available such as checkbox, date, datetime, and formula. When creating a custom field, it's important to consider the type of data that will be stored.

### Create a Custom Field

The Property object we just created is pretty bare-bones. Let’s add some custom fields to it. Head back to your Trailhead Playground.

  - From Setup, go to Object Manager | Property.
  - In the sidebar, click Fields & Relationships. Notice that there are already some fields there. There’s a name field and some of the system fields we talked about earlier.
  - Click New in the top right.
  - For data type, select Currency.
  - Click Next.
  - Fill out the following:
  - Field Label: Price
  - Description: The listed sale price of the home.
  - Check the Required box.
  - Click Next, Next again, and then Save.
You’ll see your new Price field in the list of Property fields. In the Field Name column, notice that it says Price__c. The “__c” part is an easy way to tell that a particular field is a custom field.

### Create a Record

Let’s create a property record to see what you did.

 - From the App Launcher (The App Launcher icon. in the navigation bar), find and select Sales.
 - Click the Properties tab in the navigation bar. If you don’t see it, look under the More dropdown.
 - Click New in the top corner.
 - Enter a name and price for the property and click Save.

### Customize Responsibly

When customizing objects in your org, it's important to use thoughtful and descriptive names to avoid confusion. Help your users by including descriptions and help text for specialized or complicated customizations. Additionally, require fields when necessary to ensure complete data.
