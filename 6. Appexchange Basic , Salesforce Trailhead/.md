### What About Pricing?

AppExchange offers thousands of solutions that are free to use, including Salesforce Labs solutions built in-house. Many providers offer trial versions to help users determine if a solution meets their needs. AppExchange can fit into any budget.

### Back to Ursa Major

To track the usage of Sales Cloud by Ursa Major Solar's sales team, there are three options: compiling data manually (not recommended), building a solution within Salesforce (but currently busy with other projects), or finding a suitable tool on AppExchange. Browsing through AppExchange without a plan may not be efficient, so it's best to develop a strategy.

### Develop an AppExchange Strategy

To develop an effective AppExchange strategy, consider the solution type, required functionality, budget, stakeholder needs, testing, and technical considerations. It's important to understand the needs and expectations of stakeholders and test solutions before installing them in a production org. Additionally, consider any unique requirements specific to your org.


- Solution type : Solution or consultant? You have limited resources for this project, so you really prefer something that works out of the box. That probably means a solution, such as an app.
- Functionality : You need user adoption data, such as who’s logging in most often. It’d also be nice to know which features they’re using, but that’s not essential.
- Budget : Free, if possible.
- Stakeholder needs : You definitely want to share the data that you gather with Ursa Major’s managers. They love visuals, so it would be great to show that data in a chart or graph.
- Testing : You have a Developer Edition org that you use for trying out new features and completing Trailhead challenges.
- Technical considerations : Lightning-ready and compatible with Enterprise Edition.

### How Experts Explore AppExchange Listings

#### App Listings 
AppExchange listings offer comprehensive information about apps or consultants, allowing users to confirm whether they align with their strategy. AppExchange experts can quickly assess whether an app or consultant meets their requirements by reviewing the listing. This applies to both app and consultant listings.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/appexchange_basics/appexchange_basics_listings/images/f9d284527915c272845305eca887bb89_e-8-d-537-d-9-61-eb-48-ca-b-76-f-b-01-eee-783-b-85.png)

The listing summary section of a listing provides important details such as ratings and pricing, while the listing actions bar allows you to save the listing and access additional information or start the installation process. Use these sections to determine if you want to explore the listing further or move on.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/appexchange_basics/appexchange_basics_listings/images/bf108137adcfe4d0e323e9a9ae90337a_0354-efc-9-7638-443-c-9017-f-72-e-240-adb-57.png)


The Overview tab provides information about the solution or consultant, including contact details and links to case studies. For solutions, it also includes details about the package type and contents.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/appexchange_basics/appexchange_basics_listings/images/cf08dd0826f97853ebdda4bb25597293_8-a-3-d-946-c-db-79-4062-b-60-e-d-17722498299.png)

This paragraph mentions two features of a platform: the Reviews tab and Consultant Listings. The Reviews tab displays ratings and feedback from community members, while Consultant Listings likely showcases profiles of consultants.

#### Consultant Listings

The Overview tab for consultant listings on AppExchange includes additional details such as the number of completed projects, year of firm's founding, and number of certified experts on staff. The Geographic Focus map is a unique feature that shows where the consultant does business and where its experts are located.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/appexchange_basics/appexchange_basics_listings/images/d5ec0e9a5e69d42fed62cbc54a3bb094_d-234-d-3-cc-37-d-1-4-ea-1-aae-6-184-e-768494-f-2.png)


The "Expertise" tab in consultant listings displays a consulting firm's specialization in products and industries, their level of expertise, and Salesforce certifications earned. This information can help you choose a consultant whose credentials match your project's needs.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/appexchange_basics/appexchange_basics_listings/images/b7bb39075189ffe3c3d494f3a8d2f137_5-dec-3235-c-6-dc-427-e-8-ee-4-349-ce-8-daec-53.png)


### Evaluate the Salesforce Adoption Dashboards Listing

### Put Your Trust in Community Reviews

This paragraph is discussing the importance of customer reviews in making purchasing decisions. It suggests that potential customers often look at reviews before making a purchase, and that AppExchange provides a Reviews tab where users can see both positive and negative reviews of listed products.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/appexchange_basics/appexchange_basics_listings/images/ddc282c0bd17dd7b80379b7d5828f85b_ca-9-fd-283-3703-47-a-6-ac-86-73-f-5-cc-814-c-59.png)

information on how to use the review features on AppExchange. It suggests that users can quickly compare apps using the total number of reviews, range, and average rating. Users can also filter and sort reviews by rating, recency, helpfulness, or favorability. Trusted reviews are written by select Trailblazers and can be identified by an icon next to the reviewer's name. Users can like and comment on reviews, and are encouraged to write their own reviews after trying a solution or working with a consultant. Trailhead Rangers, Salesforce MVPs, and AppExchange Top Reviewers are automatically shown as trusted reviewers when they write a review.

### Try Before You Buy

if a user has questions about whether an app meets their needs, they can try it out using one of three options on AppExchange: a test drive, install in a sandbox, or a free trial. A test drive allows the user to experience the solution in a read-only Developer Edition org configured by the provider, using sample data. If a test drive is available, it will appear in the listing actions bar near the Get It Now button.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/appexchange_basics/appexchange_basics_listings/images/16fb312886cb0bdf2bc74380cc63f817_f-84-de-87-c-2-b-03-464-a-a-617-f-7-c-4903-bc-4-a-9.png)

the other two options for trying out an app on AppExchange: installing in a sandbox or installing in a trial. Installing in a sandbox allows experts to try out solutions in a preproduction environment before making a purchase. Installing in a trial allows users to experience the solution in a writable Developer Edition org for a limited time period, with the ability to customize the org and continue using it if they decide to buy. However, not all providers offer a test drive or free trial, so users are encouraged to contact the provider if they have questions that aren't answered in the listing.

## Install AppExchange Packages

1. Objectives

  - Describe the differences between managed and unmanaged packages.
  - List key questions to ask before installing a package.
  - Install a package in your org.

### Managed and Unmanaged Packages

explains that AppExchange solutions are installed in packages, which come in two types: managed and unmanaged. The provider decides which package type to use, and this influences how the solution behaves in the user's org. Unmanaged packages allow users to get under the hood of a solution, while managed packages are easier to install and upgrade. The paragraph then suggests that the installation process will be discussed next.

### How to Install Solutions

before installing an AppExchange package can help streamline the process. Users should ensure they are installing the package in the correct org and have the login credentials available. They should also review any available documentation on the app's Overview tab. Users should consider who needs access to the solution and determine which users can access its functionality during installation. Options include admins only, all users, or specific profiles.

### Get Your Trailhead Playground Username and Password

how to find your login credentials for your Trailhead Playground in order to install a package. Users should open their Trailhead Playground and click on the "Get Your Login Credentials" tab to find their username. They should then reset their password by clicking "Reset My Password" and following the steps in the email sent to the associated email address. Once the password is reset, users can proceed with the package installation.

### Connect Your Trailhead Playground Account to Your Trailblazer.me Profile

the importance of connecting your Trailhead Playground account to your Trailblazer.me account in order to install packages. Trailblazer.me provides a single identity to log in to AppExchange and other Salesforce-related sites.

They should then click on "Settings" and under the "Connected Accounts" section, click "Connect" under the "Salesforce Accounts" header. Users should enter their Trailhead Playground username and password and click "Log In" before clicking "Link Account". These steps can also be used to connect production orgs and Developer Edition orgs to the Trailblazer.me profile.

### What Org to Choose?

compares the magic of Ursa Major solar panels to the magic of AppExchange. It explains that when a user clicks "Get It Now" to install a package, the AppExchange Account Picker displays all of their Salesforce orgs that are linked to their Trailblazer.me account and for which they have install permissions.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/appexchange_basics/appexchange_basics_install/images/1da3cf0f5010b34f03bf3607660a12d2_661799-ed-0937-4-d-86-85-c-6-5270308-cc-17-a.png)

users can select which Salesforce org to install a package into by clicking the arrows in the "Connected Salesforce Accounts" section. If the desired account is not visible, users should check that they have connected the account to their Trailblazer.me profile and have the Manage Billing permission.

### Install the Adoption Dashboards App

guidance on installing the Salesforce Adoption Dashboards package. Users should install the app in a Trailhead Playground or DE org that they use for testing, to avoid impacting Ursa Major's users. The datasheet on the Overview tab of the listing recommends following Salesforce's normal install procedure. Users should install the package for admins only, as they are the only ones who need to use it. Finally, users should search for and open the Salesforce Adoption Dashboards listing on AppExchange, and click "Get It Now" to begin the installation process.

users should choose their Trailhead Playground username from the "Connected Salesforce Accounts" dropdown and click "Install in Production". They should then check the username on the installation confirmation screen to confirm that they are installing the package in their Trailhead Playground. Finally, users should select the box to agree to the terms and conditions before proceeding with the installation.
